# ðŸŽ® Labyrinth Game

## ðŸ’» Game Using SFML 

 It is a simple game in which a character is moved using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The game window has a grass background, and there are walls surrounding the game area.

The code uses the `SFML library` for graphics and window management. The game logic is contained within the `moveInDirection` function, which takes in the elapsed time since the last frame, the pressed key, the player sprite, the window, and a vector of wall sprites. The function moves the player sprite in the direction specified by the pressed key, with a fixed speed. The function also checks for collisions between the player sprite and the wall sprites. If a collision is detected, the player sprite is moved back to a position where it is not colliding with any wall sprite.

The main function creates the game window, loads the textures for the `grass, wall, and guy` sprites, and creates the wall sprites. The game loop repeatedly draws the grass and wall sprites, and updates the player sprite based on the user input and collision detection
